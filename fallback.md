## Checkpoint 1.1
- I was stuck on how to begin writing functions for the algorithm
- I attended office hours 11/14 at 4:30pm to get set up and talk
about the general procedure for writing out algorithms.
- We also set up my Agda lib because ```Basics001``` was not working,
and my ```there exists``` unicode character was failing. 

## Checkpoint 1.2
- I got stuck on writing test for the algorithms to write the functions
- I got some help on 11/21 during class with this, and in getting
better set up for a method for my project

## Checkpoint 1.3
- I set aside between 10:30am to 4:15pm to work on Agda, but got
stuck on ```nums``` and ```alg``` because I could not get them to typecheck.
- I tried two ways of resolving these, and both seemed to not work
for my recursive case, even though I eventually got the Z or empty
list case to work. I contacted David on Slack about this on Wed 27th.
Agda hates me.

## Checkpoint 1.4
- I continued working between 11am to 12:45pm to try to get unstuck.
No luck.

## Checkpoint 1.4.1 (mistakenly 1.4 twice)
- I also tried on 11/29 to get unstuck. I made a little progress,
and started writing pseudocode, and well as a long email explaining
my angst against Agda and the world.

## Checkpoint 1.5.1
- I went to office hours on 12/2 between 3:30pm and 4pm and David
helped me get unstuck. We worked around a method of working through
the problem with a helper function, and wrote some tests.
- I am also going to try to get a bit of help in class 12/3.
- We also discussed the bitwise function and the recursive case.

## Checkpoint 1.6.1
- Worked a bit on my own after meeting with David and added fallback
file that shows progress of work

## Checkpoint 1.7.1
- Working in class on test cases and helper function.
- Spoke with David in class (12/3)
- Work on divides and divmod
- resolve finding the pi2 function in Agda

## Checkpoint 1.8.1
- ```50%``` is code. It would help to relate ideas in solution to a programming   language people use regularly that looks like English/Math (ie Python or Haskell). Added this. 
- Tried to resolve pi2. Sadness

## Checkpoint 1.9.1
- Worked on defining divmod and div and presenting what I had 

## Checkpoing 2.1.0
- Worked on divmod, div and bitwise
