Checkpoint 1.1
I was stuck on how to begin writing functions for the algorithm
I attended office hours 11/14 at 4:30pm to get set up and talk
about the general procedure for writing out algorithms

Checkpoint 1.2
I got stuck on writing test for the algorithms to write the functions
I got some help on 11/21 during class with this, and in getting
better set up for a method for my project

Checkpoint 1.3
I set aside between 10:30am to 4:15pm to work on Agda, but got
stuck on ```nums``` and ```alg``` because I could not get them to typecheck.
I tried two ways of resolving these, and both seemed to not work
for my recursive case, even though I eventually got the Z or empty
list case to work. I contacted David on Slack about this on Wed 27th.

Checkpoint 1.4
I continued working between 11am to 12:45pm to try to get unstuck.
No luck.

Checkpoint 1.4.1 (mistakenly 1.4 twice)
I also tried on 11/29 to get unstuck. I made a little progress,
and started writing pseudocode, and well as a long email explaining
my angst against Agda and the world.

Checkpoint 1.5.1
I went to office hours on 12/2 between 3:30pm and 4pm and David
helped me get unstuck. We worked around a method of working through
the problem with a helper function, and wrote some tests.
I am also going to try to get a bit of help in class 12/3.
We also discussed the bitwise function and the recursive case.
